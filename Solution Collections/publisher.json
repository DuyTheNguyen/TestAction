    "description": "he rough life of a boy is going the complete opposite way as a stranger enters his life. The stranger claims the boy has been corrupted by evil, something which has happened at birth and something which happens to a lot of people. The evil remains harmless until fully grown, but once it reaches maturity true evil will take over the mind. Fortunately there's a way to cleanse the body of this evil. Distrusful of both this situation and of this stranger, the boy unusually eagerly agrees to the proposal, there's something exciting about this whole situation, surely the right choice was made. But what if this stranger is a con artist. Or what if all this is an elaborate trap. How could an ordinary boy end up in a situation like this. Time to find out."
